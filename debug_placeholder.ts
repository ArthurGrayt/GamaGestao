import { createClient } from '@supabase/supabase-js';

// I need the URL and Key. I will look for them in the codebase.
// For now I will assume I can read them or they are in a file.
// I'll search for 'supabase.ts' to see how client is initialized.
// Actually, I can't easily run a script that imports specific local files if they depend on Vite env vars.
// I will try to read the env vars or hardcode them if finding them is easy.
// I will start by reading 'src/services/supabase.ts' or similar.
